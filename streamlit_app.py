                        **Under the Hood:**
                        
                        1. **Vectorization**: Each job description is converted into a high-dimensional vector (embedding) using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model. These vectors capture semantic meaning.
                        
                        2. **Cosine Similarity**: We calculate the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Values range from -1 to 1, where:
                           - **1.0** = Identical content
                           - **0.8-0.95** = Very similar content
                           - **0.5-0.8** = Moderately similar
                           - **< 0.5** = Low similarity
                        
                        3. **Semantic Understanding**: Unlike keyword matching, embeddings understand context and meaning. "Backend Developer" and "Server-side Engineer" would score highly even without exact word matches.
                        
                        **Next Steps for Sourcingology:**
                        - Scale to 100+ historical job descriptions
                        - Use similarity scores to predict time-to-fill
                        - Build sourcing strategy recommendations
